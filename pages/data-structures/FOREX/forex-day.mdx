## Currency Pair Format

The ticker symbol follows the format `C:BASECURRENCY[QUOTECURRENCY]` where:
- `C:` indicates a forex currency pair
- `BASE` is the first currency in the pair (being bought or sold)
- `QUOTE` is the second currency in the pair (used to price the base currency)

Examples:
- `C:EURUSD` - Euro priced in US Dollars
- `C:GBPMXN` - British Pound priced in Mexican Pesos
- `C:AUDCAD` - Australian Dollar priced in Canadian Dollars

## Notes

- All timestamps are in Unix milliseconds format
- Volume represents the number of base currency units traded
- Prices represent how much of the quote currency is needed to buy one unit of the base currency
- The transactions field represents the total number of trades executed during the day
