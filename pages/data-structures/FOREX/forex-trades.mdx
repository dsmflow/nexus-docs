# Forex Trade Level Data

This document describes the structure of forex trade level data available in the Nexus Trading platform. Trade level data provides detailed information about individual forex transactions, including bid/ask prices, exchange identifiers, and precise timestamps.

## Data Structure

Each forex trade record contains the following fields:

| Field                 | Type       | Description                                 |
|-----------------------|------------|---------------------------------------------|
| ticker                | string     | The forex pair identifier (e.g., "EUR-USD") |
| ask_exchange          | integer    | Exchange identifier for the ask price       |
| ask_price             | float      | The asking price for the currency pair      |
| bid_exchange          | integer    | Exchange identifier for the bid price       |
| bid_price             | float      | The bidding price for the currency pair     |
| participant_timestamp | integer    | Nanosecond precision Unix timestamp         |

## Example Data

```csv
Ticker,ask_exchange,ask_price,bid_exchange,bid_price,participant_timestamp
X:EUR-USD,48,1.08066,48,1.08063,1679961600000000000
X:EUR-USD,48,1.08069,48,1.08066,1679961600000000000
X:EUR-USD,48,1.08067,48,1.08064,1679961600000000000
```

## Currency Pair Format

Forex pairs follow the standard format of `BASE-QUOTE`, where:
- BASE is the base currency (first currency in the pair)
- QUOTE is the quote currency (second currency in the pair)

For example, in "EUR-USD":
- EUR is the base currency
- USD is the quote currency
- The price indicates how many USD (quote currency) are needed to buy 1 EUR (base currency)

## Exchange Identifiers

Exchange identifiers are numerical codes that represent different forex trading venues. The identifier "48" in the example represents a specific forex exchange.

## Timestamp Format

The participant_timestamp field uses nanosecond precision Unix timestamps. To convert to human-readable format:
1. Divide by 1,000,000,000 to get Unix seconds
2. Convert the resulting Unix timestamp to your desired datetime format

For example: 1679961600000000000 nanoseconds = March 28, 2023 00:00:00 UTC
