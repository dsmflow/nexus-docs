## Options Ticker Format

Options tickers follow the format: `O:SYMBOL[YYMMDD][C/P][STRIKE]`
- `O:` - Prefix indicating an options contract
- `SYMBOL` - Underlying asset symbol (e.g., SPY, IWM)
- `YYMMDD` - Expiration date (YY=year, MM=month, DD=day)
- `C/P` - Option type (C=Call, P=Put)
- `STRIKE` - Strike price (multiplied by 1000)

Example: `O:SPY230327P00390000`
- SPY: Underlying asset is SPY ETF
- 230327: Expires on March 27, 2023
- P: Put option
- 00390000: Strike price of $390.00

## Data Interpretation

- Prices are in dollars per share (not per contract)
- Each contract typically represents 100 shares of the underlying asset
- Window start time is in Unix milliseconds format
- Transactions count provides insight into daily trading activity
