# Profile Setup

The Profile Setup interface uses Natural Language Understanding (NLU) to convert your investment preferences into actionable portfolio parameters.

## Using the Interface

Our NLU system analyzes your input to extract key information about:

- Investment goals
- Risk tolerance
- Investment horizon
- Special preferences or constraints

## Example Input

Here's an example of what you might tell our system:

```text
"I'm looking for long-term growth with moderate risk tolerance. 
I want to invest for retirement in about 20 years. 
I prefer technology and healthcare sectors, and I'd like to 
maintain some liquid assets for emergencies."
```

## How It Works

### 1. Text Analysis
```javascript
// The system tokenizes and analyzes your input
const tokens = tokenizer.tokenize(text);
```

### 2. Entity Recognition
- Identifies key investment parameters
- Extracts temporal information
- Recognizes sector preferences

### 3. Profile Generation
```javascript
// Example profile output
{
  "goals": "long-term growth",
  "riskTolerance": "moderate",
  "investmentHorizon": "20 years",
  "preferences": {
    "sectors": ["technology", "healthcare"],
    "liquidity": "maintain emergency fund"
  }
}
```

## Profile Components

### Investment Goals
- Growth
- Income
- Capital preservation
- Balanced approach

### Risk Tolerance
- Conservative
- Moderate
- Aggressive
- Dynamic

### Investment Horizon
- Short-term (< 2 years)
- Medium-term (2-5 years)
- Long-term (5+ years)

## Next Steps

After your profile is created:

1. Review the generated profile summary
2. Adjust any parameters if needed
3. Proceed to [Strategy Generation](/portfolio-designer/strategies)

## API Integration

For programmatic access, use our API endpoint:

```javascript

{
  "text": "Your investment preferences in natural language",
  "additionalParams": {
    "preferredCurrency": "USD",
    "existingPortfolio": true
  }
}
```
